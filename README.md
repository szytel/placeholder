2013 Nate Szytel Placeholder work around for IE


Placeholder is an attribute for input fields. It allows text to be used inside the input field as a label that dissapears 
once a user begins to type in the field. This function is not supported currently by IE9- so a work around script is
needed.

Hope it helps!
